	<h3>Research</h3>
    <p>My current PhD project consists in an unbiased quantitative artificial intelligence (AI)-based survey of histological variation in human asymptomatic thyroids, with AI enabling the quantitative analysis of expressed histological morphologies, we can compute associated transcriptional and genetic variations and reveals morphological changes related to risk-associated loci. </p>
    
   <h3>Biography</h3>
   <p>Hi, I am Zhao, I started my PhD in October 2021. My initial academic background was biopharmaceutical engineering, with master thesis acomplished at GSK (Title : High throughput screening of protein formulation stability: Oxidation by metals and light. The goal of the study was to develop a high throughput screening protocol allowing testing protein stability in these oxidative conditions and finding the most suitable Then I've worked 5 and half years as associate manager consultant at GSK (Wavre), successively held 3 different positions: Global Validation Coordinator, Project Coordinator, Technical Regulatory Expert. formulation to stabilize proteins from a large library of different antioxidants formulations). After that, I returned to China for a PhD training in stem cell biology (Project title: Expansion of cardiovascular progenitors derived from human pluripotent stem cells. The aim of the project was to find the appropriate in vitro culture condition allowing human cardiovascular progenitor cells expansion and differentiation, without genetic manipulation; and once this step achieved, their molecular identity could be further analyzed) In 2019 I returned back in Belgium and did master in bioinformatics and modelling (Master thesis title: Computational study of shift work schedules. A non-negligible percentage of population is involved in shift work and could suffer from a chronic jet lag. Based on existing 16-variables molecular model, an organism-level variable core body temperature is added, enabling simulation of shift work conditions varying on shift light intensity, magnitude, direction and rotation speed.) During this master training, I did an intership under the supervision of <a href='vincent_detours.html'>Vincent Detours</a>, and worked on a prototype of my PhD project. </p>
