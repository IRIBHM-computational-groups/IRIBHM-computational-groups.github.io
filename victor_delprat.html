	<h3>Research</h3>
    <p>My current project focuses on the somatic evolution of the human thyroid gland in both healthy and diseased states (i.e., benign nodules and cancer), across age and sex, with the goal of improving our ability to predict their progression. We will notably perform histological staining to identify specific regions of the thyroid (e.g., solid cell nests and follicles), which will then be analyzed using laser capture microdissection followed by whole-genome sequencing. <br> Additionally, I am working on a 3D reconstruction of human thyroid morphology. For both projects, I collaborate closely with <a href='maxime_tarabichi.html'>Maxime Tarabichi</a> and <a href='vincent_detours.html'>Vincent Detours</a>.</p>
    
   <h3>Biography</h3>
   <p>Hello! My name is Victor, and I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Computational Biology lab in IRIBHM. <br> I completed a Bachelor's and a Master's degree in Cell Biology and Physiology at the University of Lille (France). During my Master's thesis (at the Institute of Biology of Lille), I conducted an in vitro screening of an anti-microRNA library to study endothelial cell activation. <br> I then pursued a PhD at the University of Namur (URBC lab), where I investigated the effect of cycling hypoxia on tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and their communication with endothelial cells. <br> Following my PhD, I worked for one year as a project leader at StratiCELL, a company specialized in testing dermatological and cosmetic products. There, I was responsible for evaluating new products using 2D and 3D cell culture models, including reconstructed human epidermis. <br> Following this industry experience, I returned to academic research, undertaking a two-year postdoctoral position at the University of Namur (LARN lab). My work focused on the role of oxygen concentration in the FLASH effect, a phenomenon observed under ultra-high dose rate irradiation that reduces normal tissue toxicity while preserving effective tumor control.</p>
