	<h3>Research</h3>
    <p>I started my PhD 1st October 2023 under the supervision of <a href='maxime_tarabichi.html'>Maxime Tarabichi</a> I'm currently working on two projects:    My master's thesis project: Genome-wide differences in mutability between parental sets of chromosomes. Basically, my goal is to find a new methodology to phase the whole genome of cancer patients in order to quantify somatic mutation and structural variants in each copy of the genome.    My PhD project: Characterization of genetic variations in repeated regions of the genome with short-read sequencing. Basically, my goal is to develop a suite of bioinformatics tools to call somatic and de-novo indels and substitutions from short read sequencing data including the non-unique genome (not well characterized), validate the tools apply it to a set of normal and cancer datasets. The final goal is to publish the tool as open source software for the general scientific community and will also make all the calls available for others to be able to mine the retrieved calls.</p>
    
   <h3>Biography</h3>
   <p>Hi, I am Maxime. I'm a PhD student in IRIBHM computational biology lab. I have a background in biomedical sciences and bioinformatics. I achieved a master in Biomedical Sciences at the University of Mons (UMONS) during which I contributed to two research projects. For my master's thesis, in the Laboratory of Metabolic and Molecular Biochemistry of UMONS, I studied of C1qBP functions in healthy and FSHD skeletal muscle cells with a specific focus on autophagy. During my Erasmus internship, in the Department of Paediatrics at Oxford University, I worked on the development of new delivery methods for microdystrophin gene therapy. Then, I achieved a second master in Bioinformatics and Modelling at ULB. During this master I performed a company internship at GSK in the Research and Development department in order to characterize proteinâ€™s antigenic surface attribute. Finally, I performed my master's thesis under the supervision of <a href='maxime_tarabichi.html'>Maxime Tarabichi</a> in the computational biology lab of IRIBHM where I studied the genome-wide differences in mutability between parental sets of chromosomes.</p>
